    <h2>Oreo</h2>
    <img class = "thumbnail" src="images/oreo_sitting.JPG" alt = "black pug terrier" width="400">
    <p>Oreo is a 20 pound pug terrier who is 6 years old. He loves following people around and always wants attention from anyone. He will play with any dog toys, especially the ones that you take from him. He likes going out on walks anytime of the day except when it is thunder storming, he will be running around the house trying to find a place to hide.</p>
    <p>After every walk, Oreo will always get the zoomies, or he will want to play fetch. He has a set schedule everyday where he likes to eat early morning around 9am and at night at 7pm. Oreo is a very high maintenance dog who needs a lot of attention but will give you all the love and kisses.</p>

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <h2>Milktea</h2>
            <img src="images/Main.JPG" width = "400" alt="Milktea taking nap">

            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”</p> 
            <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.  </p>

            <p>Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix.  Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. She loves to go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. Sofie loves freshly cut grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.</p> 
            <p>Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the trail, where she can be let free to run to he hearts content.  </p>

            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out. </p> 
            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.   </p>

            <p>Basil, otherwise known as Slaysil, is a very energetic white, slightly crusty and trusty, dog (bichon) . She gets princess treatment in her household, but also out in public. As a consequence, she is very clingy and loves to lick, especially in the face. </p> 
            <p>She endeavors in multiple hobbies and activities, which include flying, licking, standing on two legs, ringing bells, and jumping through hula hoops.

            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. </p> 
            <p>Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it’s because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.   </p>
